# Sleep Health and Lifestyle
Introduction 

I aimed to analyze a dataset on sleep health and lifestyle using SQL. By leveraging SQL queries, I gained valuable insights into sleep patterns, identified trends, and explored relationships between different factors and sleep outcomes.

Dataset Description

The sleep health and lifestyle dataset used in this analysis is sourced from Kaggle. The dataset covers a wide range of variables related to sleep and daily habits such as age, occupation, sleep duration, quality of sleep, stress levels, the presence or absence of sleep disorders, and other variables that can impact sleep health. The dataset encompasses a diverse range of individuals and their corresponding sleep-related metrics.

Objectives

The main objectives of this SQL data analysis project include:

1. Exploring the distribution of sleep duration and sleep quality ratings within the dataset

2. Analyzing physical activity levels, stress levels, and BMI categories.

3. Identifying any patterns or trends in sleep duration and quality based on demographic factors such as age and gender.

4. Examining blood pressure and heart rate measurements.

5. Investigating the occurrence of sleeping disorders between occupations


Tools and Technologies

To perform the data analysis, I utilized the following tools and technologies:

SQL: Wrote SQL queries in order to extract and manipulate data from the sleep health and lifestyle dataset.

Data Visualization Tools: Tableau

Conclusion

By leveraging SQL and conducting a thorough analysis of the sleep health and lifestyle dataset, I was able to gain valuable insights into sleep patterns, factors affecting sleep duration and quality, and their relationship with lifestyle variables. My project will provide actionable recommendations to enhance sleep health and contribute to overall well-being.
